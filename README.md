# React Native Asynchronous Operation Handling in componentDidMount

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in React Native applications related to asynchronous operations within the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method. The issue stems from the asynchronous nature of network requests (using `fetch` in this example) and the component's rendering process.

## The Problem

The provided `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code. The `fetch` call is made inside `componentDidMount`, but the component renders *before* the `fetch` promise resolves. This can lead to the following:

* **Stale Data:** The component renders with `this.state.data` as `null` and only updates after the data is fetched, creating a temporary display of the loading message when data is already available. 
* **Race Conditions:** If multiple asynchronous operations occur, it's possible for the component to render with an incorrect or outdated state, depending on when the network requests finish.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file illustrates a corrected approach. It utilizes the `async/await` syntax for more readable and manageable asynchronous code. The `setLoading` method manages a loading indicator, providing better user experience.
